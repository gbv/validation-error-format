    "This document specifies a data format to report validation errors of digital objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Data validation is a crucial part of management of data qualitiy and interoperability. Validation is applied in many ways and contexts, for instance input forms and editors with visual feedback or schema languages with formal error reports. The diversity of use cases imply a variety of error results. No common standard exist to express error reports.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The specification of **Data Validation Error Format** has two goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   unify how validation errors are reported by different validators\n",
    "-   address positions of errors in validated documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least the format should help to better separate validation and presentation of validation results, so both can be solved by different applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Caution**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The format is strictly limited to errors and error positions. Neither does it include other kinds of analysis results such as statistics and summaries of documents, nor does in include details about validation such as test cases, schema rules, and individual constraints. Errors can be linked to additional information with error types but the semantics of these types is out of the scope of this specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "@fig-validation illustrates the validation process with core concepts used in this specification: a **validator** checks whether a **document** conforms to some requirements and returns a list of **errors** in return. Each error can refer to its location in the document via a **position**.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] A notable exception are formats from software development used in unit testing such as [JUnit XML](https://github.com/testmoapp/junitxml) and [Test Anything Protocol](https://testanything.org/)."

    "Every document conforms to a **document model**. For instance JSON documents conforms to the JSON model, and character strings conforms to the model “sequence of characters from a known character set”. Document models come with **encodings** how to express documents in form of documents on a lower level. For instance JSON documents can be encoded with JSON syntax as Unicode strings and Unicode strings can be encoded with UTF-8 as sequences of bytes (solid arrows in @fig-encodings-and-locators).\n",
