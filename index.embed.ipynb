    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation and scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Data validation is a crucial part of management of data qualitiy and interoperability. Validation is applied in many ways and contexts, for instance input forms and editors with visual feedback or schema languages with formal error reports. The diversity of use cases imply a variety of error results. No uniform standard exist to express error reports (apart from formats used in unit testing in software development such as [JUnit XML](https://github.com/testmoapp/junitxml)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The specification of **Data Validation Error Format** has two goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   unify how validation errors are reported by different validators\n",
    "-   address positions of errors in validated documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least the format should help to better separate validation and presentation of validation results, so both can be solved by different applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format is strictly limited to errors and error positions. Neither does it include other kinds of analysis results such as statistics and summaries of documents, nor does in include concepts of test cases, schemas or other information about validation internals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "@fig-validation illustrates the validation process with core concepts used in this specification: a **validator** checks whether a **document** conforms to some requirements and returns a list of **errors** in return. Each error can refer to its locations in the document via **positions**. These concepts are defined more formally with details in the following normative section."

    "Every document conforms to a **document model**. For instance a JSON document conforms to the JSON model, and a character string conforms to the model “sequence of characters from a known character set”. Document models come with **encodings** how to express conforming documents in form of documents of another document model on a lower level. For instance a JSON document can be encoded with JSON syntax in Unicode strings and Unicode strings can be encoded with UTF-8 as sequence of bytes (see labeled arrows in @fig-encodings-and-locators). Eventually all documents are given as digital objects, encoded as sequence of bytes. Encodings using a sequence of characters are also called textual data formats, in contrast to binary data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error positions are given in form of **locators**, each conforming to a **locator model**. Each locator model refers to a limited set of document models: for instance JSON Pointer refers to JSON, line numbers refer to any model segmenting a document into a sequence of lines, and index numbers refer to any model with a sequence of elements – such as sequences of bytes and Unicode strings (@fig-encodings-and-locators).[1] The Data Validation Error Format requires each locator model to have exactely one encoding called its **locator format** to encode locators as Unicode strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] Unicode strings are sequences of code points, which are different from characters, so “character position” is a different locator model. Line numbers in Unicode are not trivial neither because multiple definitions of line breaks exist."
