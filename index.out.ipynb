    "This document specifies a data format to report validation errors of digital objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Data validation is a crucial part of management of data qualitiy and interoperability. Validation is applied in many ways and contexts, for instance input forms and editors with visual feedback or schema languages with formal error reports. The diversity of use cases imply a variety of error results. No common standard exist to express error reports.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The specification of **Data Validation Error Format** has two goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   unify how validation errors are reported by different validators\n",
    "-   address positions of errors in validated documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least the format should help to better separate validation and presentation of validation results, so both can be solved by different applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Warning**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The format is strictly limited to errors and error positions. Neither does it include other kinds of analysis results such as statistics and summaries of documents, nor does in include details about validation such as test cases, schema rules, and individual constraints. Errors can be linked to additional information with error types but the semantics of these types is out of the scope of this specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"#fig-validation\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Figure 1</a> illustrates the validation process with core concepts used in this specification: a **validator** checks whether a **document** conforms to some requirements and returns a list of **errors** in return. Each error can refer to its locations in the document via **positions**.\n",

    "<figure class=''>\n",

    "\n",
    "Every document conforms to a **document model**. For instance JSON documents conforms to the JSON model, and character strings conforms to the model “sequence of characters from a known character set”. Document models come with **encodings** how to express documents in form of documents on a lower level in form. For instance JSON documents can be encoded with JSON syntax as Unicode strings and Unicode strings can be encoded with UTF-8 as sequences of bytes (solid arrows in <a href=\"#fig-encodings-and-locators\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Figure 2</a>).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Eventually all documents are given as digital objects, encoded as sequence of bytes. Encodings using a sequence of characters are also called textual data formats, in contrast to binary data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error positions are given in form of **locators**, each expressed in a **locator format**. Locator formats refer to sets of document models: for instance [JSON Pointer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901) refers to JSON, character and line numbers refer to character strings with defined line breaks, and offsets refer to sequences of elements (<a href=\"#fig-encodings-and-locators\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Figure 2</a>).<!-- ^[Unicode strings are sequences as well but its not obvious whether the elements are code points, code units or characters. Line numbers in Unicode are not trivial neither because multiple definitions of line breaks exist.]-->\n",

    "## 1.2 Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Documents can be invalid compared to document models on many levels. For example the string `{\"åå\":5}` is valid JSON but it might be invalid if element `åå` is expected to hold a string instead of a number (<a href=\"#lst-1\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Example 1</a>). The error can be located with JSON Pointer in the JSON document and with line and character number of its encoding as Unicode string:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"message\": \"Expected string, got number at element /åå\",\n",
    "  \"position\": { \"jsonpointer\": \"/åå\", \"line\": \"1\", \"char\": \"7\" }\n",
    "}\n",

    "\n",
    "Example 1: Error in a JSON document\n",
    "\n",
    "The document could also be invalid at JSON syntax level, for example of the closing `}` is missing (<a href=\"#lst-2\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Example 2</a>). The error is also located by its byte offset:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"message\": \"Unexpected end of JSON input at character 8\",\n",
    "  \"position\": { \"line\": \"1\", \"char\": \"8\", \"offset\": \"10\" }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: Error in JSON syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar document could be invalid on byte level. The following table illustrates the document from <a href=\"#lst-1\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Example 1</a> with ninth byte replaced by a value not allowed in UTF-8. It is common practice to replace such bytes with the Unicode replacement character `U+FFFD` but the resulting Unicode string is invalid JSON syntax still (<a href=\"#lst-3\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Example 3</a>). The example also illustrates another locator format `linecol` to give a character position by line and column.\n",
