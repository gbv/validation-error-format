# Introduction

Data validation is a crucial part of management of data qualitiy and interoperability. Validation is applied in many ways and contexts, for instance input forms and editors with visual feedback or schema languages with formal error reports. The diversity of use cases imply a variety of error results. No common standard exist to express error reports.^[A notable exception are formats from software development used in unit testing such as [JUnit XML](https://github.com/testmoapp/junitxml) and [Test Anything Protocol](https://testanything.org/).]

The specification of **Data Validation Error Format** has two goals:

- unify how validation errors are reported by different validators
- address positions of errors in validated documents

Last but not least the format should help to better separate validation and presentation of validation results, so both can be solved by different applications.

:::{.callout-caution}
The format is strictly limited to errors and error positions. Neither does it include other kinds of analysis results such as statistics and summaries of documents, nor does in include details about validation such as test cases, schema rules, and individual constraints. Errors can be linked to additional information with error types but the semantics of these types is out of the scope of this specification.
:::

## Overview

@fig-validation illustrates the validation process with core concepts used in this specification: a **validator** checks whether a **document** conforms to some requirements and returns a list of **errors** in return. Each error can refer to its location in the document via a **position**.

::: {#fig-validation}

```{mermaid fig-align=left}
graph LR
   document --- validator --> errors
   errors -. positions .-> document
   validator(validator)
```
Validation process
:::

Every document conforms to a **document model**. For instance JSON documents conforms to the JSON model, and character strings conforms to the model "sequence of characters from a known character set". Document models come with **encodings** how to express documents in form of documents on a lower level. For instance JSON documents can be encoded with JSON syntax as Unicode strings and Unicode strings can be encoded with UTF-8 as sequences of bytes (solid arrows in @fig-encodings-and-locators).

:::{.callout-note}
Eventually all documents are given as digital objects, encoded as sequence of bytes. Encodings using a sequence of characters are also called textual data formats, in contrast to binary data formats.
:::

An error position is given in form of one or more **locators**, each having a **dimension** and an **address**. Each dimension refers to a **locator format** for a set of document models. For instance [JSON Pointer] refers to JSON, character and line numbers refer to character strings with defined line breaks, and offsets refer to sequences of elements (@fig-encodings-and-locators). Other examples of locator formats include [XPath] for XML, and row/column for tabular data.

Locators can also contain **nested errors** to address a more specific position within another position and to support error positions in nested documents such as archive files.

::: {#fig-encodings-and-locators}

```{mermaid fig-align=left}

   JSON -- JSON syntax --> Unicode
   Unicode -- UTF-8   --> Bytes

   char -.-> Unicode
   line -.-> Unicode

```
Example of encodings and locator formats
:::

## Examples

Documents can be invalid on many levels. For example the string `{"åå":5}` is valid JSON but it might be invalid if element `åå` is expected to hold a string instead of a number (@lst-1). The error can be located with JSON Pointer in the JSON document and with character and line number:

```{#lst-1 .json lst-cap="Error in a JSON document"}
{
  "message": "Expected string, got number at element /åå",
  "position": { "jsonpointer": "/åå", "char": "7", "line": 1 }
}
```

The string could also be part of a larger, newline-delimited JSON document. In this case it makes sense to use a nested error (@lst-4):

```{#lst-4 .json lst-cap="Error in a newline-delimited JSON document"}
{
  "message": "Invalid document at line 7",
  "position": [ {
    "dimension": "line",
    "address": "7",
    "errors": [ {
      "message": "Expected string, got number at element /åå",
      "position": {
        "jsonpointer": "/åå", "char": "7", "line": 1
      }
    } ]
  } ]
}
```


The document could also be invalid at JSON syntax level, for example if the closing `}` is missing (@lst-2):

```{#lst-2 .json lst-cap="Error in JSON syntax"}
{
  "message": "Unexpected end of JSON input at character 8",
  "position": { "line": "1", "char": "8"  }
}
```

A similar document could be invalid on byte level. The following table illustrates the document from @lst-1 with ninth byte replaced by a value not allowed in UTF-8. It is common practice to replace such bytes with the Unicode replacement character `U+FFFD` but the resulting Unicode string is invalid JSON syntax still (@lst-3). The example also illustrates another locator format `linecol` to give a character position by line and column.

+---------------:+:------:+:------:+:------:+:------:+:------:+:------:+:------:+:------:+:------:+:------:+
| **Byte**       |`7b`    |`22`    |`c3`    |`a5`    |`c3`    |`a5`    |`22`    |`3a`    |`c0`    |`7d`    |
+----------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| **Code point** |`U+007B`|`U+0022`|`U+00E5`         |`U+00E5`         |`U+007B`|`U+0022`|`ERROR⇒`|`U+0022`|
|                |        |        |                 |                 |        |        |`U+FFFD`|        |
+----------------+--------+--------+-----------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| **Character**  |`{`     |`"`     |`å`              |`å`              |`"`     |`:`     |`�`     |`}`     |
+----------------+--------+--------+-----------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+



::: {#lst-3 lst-cap="Invalid JSON on multiple levels"}


```{.json}
[
  {
    "level": "warning",
    "message": "Ill-formed UTF-8 byte sequence at offset 8",
    "position": { "line": "1", "char": "7", "offset": "8" }
  },
  {
    "level": "error",
    "message": "Expected JSON value at line 1, column 7",
    "position": { "line": "1", "char": "7", "linecol": "1:7" }
  }
]

## Conformance requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 ([RFC 2119] and [RFC 8174]) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

Only section @sec-errors to @sec-dimensions, excluding examples and notes, and the [list of normative references](#normative-references) are normative parts of this specification.

Specific support of Data Validation Error Format by an application depends on two options. Both MUST be documented by applications:

1. Support of either the full format or only [**positions**](#positions) in condense form being [**locator maps**](#locator-map)
2. The set of supported [**dimensions**](#sec-dimensions)

# Errors {#sec-errors}

An **Error** is a JSON object with: 

- mandatory field `message` with an **error message**, being a non-empty string.
  Applications MAY use a default value for error messages.

- optional field `types` with an array of **error types**, each being a non-empty string.
  Error types can be used for grouping errors and they SHOULD be URIs. Repetitions of
  identical strings in the same array MUST be ignored.

- optional field `level` with an **error level**, being one of the strings `error`, `warning`, or `info`.
  Application MUST NOT differentiate between error level `error` and no error level.

- optional field `position` with a [**position**](#positions). Applications MUST NOT differentiate between empty position and no position.

::: {.callout-note}
Language and localization of error messages is out of the scope of this specification.
:::

# Positions

An error can have a **position**. A position is given

- either in **full form** as JSON array of [**locators**](#locators),

- or in **condense form** with a [**locator map**](#locator-maps).

Every locator map can be transformed to an equivalent array of locators. The reverse transformation is only possible if there is at most one locator per dimension and no locator has nested errors.

::: {.callout-note}
Locators of the same positions should refer to roughly the "same" part of a document or at least have a common intersection.
This requirement is difficult to formalize because locators refer to different document models, so it is no normative part of this specification yet.
:::

[locator format]: #locator-formats
[locator map]:: #locator-maps

## Locators

A **Locator** is a JSON object with

- mandatory field `dimension` with the name of a [**dimension**](#dimensions)

- mandatory field `address` with the **address**, being a string conforming to the **locator format** identified by the name of the **dimension**.

- optional field `errors` with an array of nested [**errors**](#sec-errors) within the located part of a document.


```{#lst-locator .json lst-cap="A simple locator"}
{ "dimension": "line", "address": "7" }
```

Nested errors allow to reference locations within nested documents (@lst-nested-example and @lst-nested-example-2):

```{#lst-nested-example .json lst-cap="An error in line 2 of file `example.txt` in archive `archive.zip`"}
{
  "message": "Invalid value in line 2 in file example.txt in file archive.zip",
  "position": [ {
    "dimension": "file",
    "address": "archive.zip",
    "errors": [ {
      "message": "Invalid value in line 2 in file example.txt",
      "position": [ {
        "dimension": "file",
        "address": "example.txt",
        "errors": [ { 
          "message": "Invalid value in line 2",
          "position": { "line": "2" }
        } ]
      } ]
    } ]
  } ]
}
```

```{#lst-nested-example-2 .json lst-cap="An error with position given in two forms, one with a nested error"}
{
  "message": "Invalid character in line 7, column 3",
  "position": [ {
    "dimension": "linecol",
    "address": "7:3"
  }, {
    "dimension": "line",
    "address": "7",
    "errors": [ {
      "message": "Invalid character 3",
      "position": { "char": "3" }
    } ]
  } ]
}
```

## Locator maps

A **locator map** is a JSON object that maps names of [**dimensions**](#sec-dimensions) to **addresses**.

```{#lst-locator-map .json lst-cap="A simple locator map indicating the position line 7, character 42"}
{ "line": "7", "char": "42" }
```

A locator map is equivalent to an array of locators with key and value of the JSON object entries mapped to field `dimension` and `address` of each locator. An array of locators can be reduced to a locator map by dropping all nested errors and selecting only the first locator of each locator format.

Applications MAY restrict their support of Data Validation Error Format to positions with locator maps. In this case nested errors and positions with multiple locators per dimension are not supported.

# Dimensions {#sec-dimensions}

A **dimension** is a defined method to address parts of a document. Each dimension has:

- a unique **name**, being a string that start with lowercase letter `a` to `z`, optionally followed by a sequence of lowercase letters, digits `0` to `9` and/or `-`.

- a **locator format**, being a formal language of Unicode strings to encode references to parts of a document. The sets of strings of the language are called **addresses**.

- a **document model** matching the **locator format**.

Applications SHOULD support the following dimensions:

name            | locator format        | document model
---------------:|-----------------------|----------------------
`offset`        | [offset number]       | sequence of elements
`char`          | [character number]    | sequence of characters or code points
`cell`          | [cell reference]      | tabular data
`file`          | [file path]           | directory tree
`line`          | [line number]         | sequence of lines
`linecol`       | [line and column]     | sequence of characters with line breaks
`jsonpointer`   | [JSON Pointer]        | JSON
`xpath`         | [XML Path Expression] | XML or compatible hierarchies

<!--
A **validator** is an executable function that transforms a **document** into a (possibly empty) set of **errors**.
The document is valid in this context if the set of errors is empty.

^[Unicode strings are sequences as well but its not obvious whether the elements are code points, code units or characters. Line numbers in Unicode are not trivial neither because multiple definitions of line breaks exist.]

For instance a `line` locator assumes a model of lines and a `region` locator assumes an image. The encoding of this model, for instance a text file or an image file, is out of the scope of the locator language.

The set of normative locator formats has not been finally specified yet. The final version of this specification may need to define a registry of locator formats. The following locator formats will likely be included:
-->

See @sec-additional-dimensions for more dimensions.

### Sequential document models

#### Offset number

The **offset number** locator format with name `number` is used to reference an element in a sequence of elements. The locator value is non-negative integer encoded as string without leading zeroes. The first element has number zero (locator value `0`).

#### Character number

The **character number** locator format with name `char` is used to reference a character in a sequence of characters from a character set. The locator value is a positive integer encoded as string without leading zeroes. The first character has number one (locator value `1`).

In Unicode strings, this locator format refers to code points instead of visual characters.

#### Line number

:::{.callout-warning}
Possibly requires some more detailled specification. For instance line number depend on a common definition of line breaks, some formats include U+0B, U+0C, U+85, U+2028, U+2029...
:::

#### Line and Column

[Line number] and [character position] within the line, separated by colon `:` ...

### Tabular document models

#### Cell reference

The **cell reference** locator format with name `cell` is used to reference a cell or a range of cells in a table as known from spreadsheet software. The locator value consists of a pair of column and row, optionally followed by colon (`:`) and another pair of column and row. Columns are given in hexavigesimal system (A=1, B=2..., Z=26, AA=27, AB=28...) and rows are given by numbers, starting from 1.

### Hierarchical document models

#### File path

The **file path** locator format with name `file` is used to reference a file or directory in a directory tree. The locator value must be a POSIX path, being a string optionally beginning with a slash (`/`), followed by zero or more file names, separated by slash. A file name is a non-empty sequence of Unicode code points excluding the slash (`U+002F`) and the null byte (`U+0000`).

::: {.callout-note}
Depending in the document model, file names may be defined as binary string instead of Unicode strings. In most cases UTF-8 encoding can be assumed to map Unicode code points to bytes but (TODO: this requires more careful examination). 
:::

#### JSON Pointer

...

See <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901>

#### XML Path Expression

TODO: Subset of XPath, see <https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/#id-path-expressions> (must start with `/`, no filter expressions, no reverse steps, no predicates except numbers.

## Additional dimensions {#sec-additional-dimensions .unnumbered}

The following [dimensions](#sec-dimensions) are not normative part of the specification because they have not fully been specified yet:

name        | locator format   | document models
------------|------------------|------------------
`fq`        | format and path  | all binary formats supported by [fq] (see @lst-fq)
`rfc5147`   | [RFC 5147](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5147) | characters and lines
`rfc7111`   | [RFC 7111](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7111) | tabular date
`id`        | Unicode string | data models that refer to elements with an identifier

`rfc5147`, in contrast to `char` and `line`, also supports ranges. `rfc7111`, in contrast to `cell`, also supports ranges and multi-selection.

[fq]: https://github.com/wader/fq?tab=readme-ov-file#fq

```{#lst-fq .json lst-cap="Error using fq to locate the internal timestamp of a file in a .gz archive"}
{
  "message": "Timestamp must not be in the future!",
  "position": {
    "fq": "gzip:.members[0].mtime"
  }
}
```

The following locator formats or standards are yet to be evaluated for its use as dimension:

- `RangeAddress` of [References in OpenDocument](https://docs.oasis-open.org/office/OpenDocument/v1.4/OpenDocument-v1.4-part4-formula.html#References)
- IIIF (section in an image)
